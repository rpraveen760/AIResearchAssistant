Explain self attention,"Self-attention, also known as intra-attention, is a mechanism that relates different positions of a single sequence to compute a representation of that sequence. It has been used successfully in various tasks such as reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment, and learning task-independent sentence representations.

In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length is smaller than the representation dimensionality, which is commonly the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations.

Moreover, self-attention provides a side benefit of leading to more interpretable models as individual attention heads can learn to perform different tasks, many of which exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of sentences.",3
Explain multi head attention,"Multi-head attention is a mechanism in the Transformer model that allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. In contrast to a single attention head which can't achieve this due to averaging. The mechanism works by taking the input of queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V) and projecting them into multiple heads. Specifically, the operation is done in parallel across h = 8 heads and each head reduces dmodel dimensions into a smaller number e.g., dmodel/h = 64. The computational cost is thus similar to single-head attention with full dimensionality.

Multi-head attention is used in three ways in the Transformer model:

1. In ""encoder-decoder attention"" layers, queries come from the previous decoder layer while the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to be attentive over all positions in the input sequence.

2. The encoder contains self-attention layers where all keys, values, and queries come from the same place (the output of the previous layer in the encoder). Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in its previous layer.

3. The decoder includes a sub-layer that performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. A masking technique is used to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions ensuring predictions for a position i can depend only on known outputs at positions less than i.",2
Explain self attention,"Self-attention, also known as intra-attention, is an attention mechanism that relates different positions within a single sequence to calculate a representation of that sequence. This approach has been used in tasks such as reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment, and learning task-independent sentence representations. Unlike recurrent networks based on sequence-aligned recurrence, self-attention incorporates end-to-end memory networks to perform tasks. 

In practice, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations making it computationally less complex than recurrent layers, especially when the sequence length is smaller than the representation dimensionality. This approach could be modified for tasks with very long sequences by restricting self-attention to a neighborhood of a certain size in the input sequence.

Another benefit of self-attention is that it can yield more interpretable models. Attention distributions can be evaluated to understand the behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences. In context of the Transformer model, it completely relies on self-attention to compute input and output representations.",3
Explain attention in transformers,"Attention in Transformers is a mechanism that models dependencies in input and output without regard to their distance in the sequence. It allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when producing an output. The Transformer model uses multi-head attention in three ways: 

1. ""Encoder-decoder attention"" layers, where the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence.

2. The encoder contains self-attention layers. Here, all of the keys, values, and queries come from the same place, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. It means each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.

3. Self-attention, also known as intra-attention, is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence to compute a representation of the sequence.

With the help of attention mechanisms, the Transformer model can significantly outperform architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers.",2
explain multi head attention in transformers,"Multi-head attention in Transformers allows the model to focus on different information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With the same computational cost of single-head attention, it uses multiple (h=8 in default configuration) attention layers concurrently. Each layer leverages a reduced dimension, enabling the model to better encode input information. This is possible due to applying parameter matrices, which are different for each head, to the input data. The Transformers use multi-head attention in three ways: in ""encoder-decoder attention"" layers, queries come from the previous decoder layer, and keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. In the encoder, self-attention layers are applied where all keys, values, and queries come from the same place, which is the output of the previous layer in the encoder. This allows each position in the encoder to attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder. Overall, the use of multi-head attention allows the Transformers model to capture various aspects of the input sequence, leading to more parallelization, faster training, and better translation performance.
